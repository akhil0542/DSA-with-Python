This repository contains my learning journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. It includes:

🧠 Implementations of core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)

🔍 Solutions to common algorithmic problems (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.)

📚 Practice problems from online platforms

✍️ Well-commented code for better understanding

The goal of this repo is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and build a solid foundation in DSA with Python.
